# Project Title

This is an updated version of the alien invasion game which I built after reading the book "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes. Such an amazing book for those who want to learn Python.


# About the game

The game interface looks like this: your high score, score, level, and number of ships remaining are all displayed on the screen. Aliens appear randomly from the top at intervals of 5 seconds.
