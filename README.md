# Alien Game

This is an updated version of the alien invasion game which I built after reading the book "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes. Such an amazing book for those who want to learn Python.

 When you press a space bar  firing bullet sound come a white bullet come from the top of spaceship as you hit the alien you get 10 points the points obtained by you keeps on changing as your level increases.
 When you score is between 0 to 50 your level is 1 ,50 to 100 your level becomes 2 and level keeps on increaseing.
 With increase in level the alien falling speed increases , time interval between two aliens decreases and speed of space ship increases
