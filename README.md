# Project Title

This is an updated version of the alien invasion game which I built after reading the book "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes. Such an amazing book for those who want to learn Python.

Aliens appear randomly from the top at intervals of 5 seconds.There is count variable which counts how many aliens reaches the bootom as the 3 aliens reaches the bottom or you missed three aliens the total ship count decreases by 1
